## ðŸ“– Key Concepts Used

- **Abstract Classes & Inheritance**
- **Interfaces (`ICloneable`, `IComparable`)**
- **Array-based collections (not using `List<T>`)**
- **Event Handling & Delegates**
- **File Logging**
- **XML Documentation Comments**
- **Exam Correction with a `Dictionary<Question, Answer>`**

## ðŸ”§ Customization Ideas

- Add more question types.
- Save exam results to a CSV or database.
- Implement timers.
- Build a GUI version using WinForms or WPF.
- Allow dynamic question creation instead of hardcoded ones.
